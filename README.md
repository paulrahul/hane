## Privacy Policy
HaNe does NOT send any private user data to any foreign machine or entity. Users can optionally one-time provide their OpenAI API key which is stored **only** in user's local Chrome storage to avoid repeating this action. Users need to provide this only if they want to avail the AI Summary feature. The extension UI makes it clear that the API key is stored locally only. Other than that, error reports are sent to an email address when unexpected errors are encountered. These error reports contain only code stack traces and time and date of occurrence information.
